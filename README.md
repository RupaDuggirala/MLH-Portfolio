<h1 align="center">Rupa's MLH Portfolio</h1>

In Fall 2020, I was a Technical Program Management Intern at Major League Hacking (MLH)! Here's some information about the program:
* I was selected from over 10,000 applicants to be part of the inaugural class of 70 MLH Explorer Fellows; the program is powered by GitHub + Facebook.
* I worked collaboratively with a diverse team of student developers to craft technical solutions to real-world problems through a series of hacking sprints.
